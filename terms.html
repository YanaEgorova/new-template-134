          In order to obtain your refund, contact customer service by phone
          and obtain an RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) number to place
          on your package. Write this number on the outside of the shipping
          package, and send the product back to our fulfillment center at the
          address listed below, within thirty (30) days of the date you
          originally ordered the product. In order for your refund to be
          processed the product must arrive at our fulfillment facility within
          thirty (30) days of the original purchase date. You pay for return
          shipping. This fee will be taken out of the refund issued. Once our

          information to us, you will be issued a refund. Your refund will be
          credited back to your bank account, and may take up to 3-5 business

          If you provide us with insufficient or incorrect information your
          refund will be delayed. Once a refund has been approved please allow

          You agree that from time to time we may remove the service for

          You expressly agree that your use of, or inability to use, the

          expressly stated by us) provided ‘as is’ and ‘as available’ for your

          consequential damages of any kind, including, without limitation
          lost profits, lost revenue, lost savings, loss of data, replacement
          costs, or any similar damages, whether based in contract, tort
          (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise, arising from
          your use of any of the service or any products procured using the
          service, or for any other claim related in any way to your use of
          the service or any product, including, but not limited to, any

          of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states
          or jurisdictions, our liability shall be limited to the maximum
          extent permitted by law.

        <p class="text">
          In the event that any provision of these Terms of Service is

          applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be
          severed from these Terms of Service, such determination shall not
